In this task I develop a Python program that performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of product reviews.

Sentiment analysis coding is important to understand large volumes of natural language data (e.g. support chats, surveys, or customer review feedback). The insights gained help companies to understand consumer 
needs better, improve operations, products or services accordingly.

Code contents:
1. Implement a sentiment analysis model using spaCy.
2. Preprocess the text data.
3. Create a function for sentiment analysis.
4. Test your model on sample product reviews.
